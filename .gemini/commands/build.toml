# Build

Build the frontend application.

## Instructions

Build the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
```

This will:
1. Compile TypeScript
2. Bundle with Vite
3. Output to `frontend/dist/`

Report build results including any warnings or errors.

## Important Notes
- The build output goes to `frontend/dist/`
- This is what gets served by the FastAPI backend in production
- The Docker build uses this output
- Run this before Docker builds to ensure the frontend is up to date
- Build artifacts are uploaded as CI artifacts in the GitHub workflow
