# Lint

Run linting for both backend and frontend.

## Current Files Changed
- Modified files: !{git diff --name-only HEAD | head -10}

## Instructions

Run the following lint commands in parallel:

### Backend (Python)
```bash
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && ruff check .
```

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
```bash
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

Report any linting errors found and suggest fixes. If both pass, confirm that linting completed successfully.

## Important Notes
- The virtual environment is at `backend/venv` (created by `uv sync`)
- Backend uses ruff for linting
- Frontend uses ESLint configured for React and TypeScript
- Fix any issues found before committing code
