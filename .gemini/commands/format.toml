# Format

Format code using ruff for the backend.

## Instructions

### Check Formatting
To check if formatting is correct without making changes:
```bash
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && ruff format --check .
```

### Apply Formatting
To apply formatting:
```bash
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && ruff format .
```

Report the results and any files that were reformatted.

## Important Notes
- The virtual environment is at `backend/venv` (created by `uv sync`)
- Backend uses ruff format with 100 character line length and double quotes
- Frontend doesn't have a separate formatting step (handled by ESLint/Prettier if configured)
- Run `ruff format --check .` before committing to verify formatting
