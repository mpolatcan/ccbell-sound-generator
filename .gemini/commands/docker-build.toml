# Docker Build

Build the production Docker image.

## Instructions

Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t ccbell-sound-generator .
```

This multi-stage build:
1. Uses uv to sync dependencies from lockfile
2. Installs CPU-only PyTorch automatically
3. Copies the frontend build from `frontend/dist/`
4. Creates a lean runtime image
5. Runs as non-root user (uid 1000)

## With Version Tag
```bash
docker build -t ccbell-sound-generator:v1.0.0 .
```

## Important Notes
- Ensure `frontend/dist/` exists (run /build first if needed)
- The image is optimized for HuggingFace Spaces free CPU tier
- Build uses uv lockfile for reproducible dependencies
- The `.dockerignore` excludes source files, reducing context size
- Health check runs every 30s on `/api/health`
